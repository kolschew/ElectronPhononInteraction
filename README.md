# ElectronPhononInteraction
This code was developed for my bachelor thesis to investigate the interaction of electrons and phonons on 2-d quantum films.
All numerical routines used throughout the process were independently written and are contained in the folder numerics. 

The program main serves as runner for the program and contains the choice for the parameterization of the matrix elements and the grid for the inverse grid vectors.
